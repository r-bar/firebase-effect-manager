# Firebase Push ID Generator Toy App

This is an elm implementation of the [Firebase unique ID generation algorithm](https://gist.github.com/mikelehen/3596a30bd69384624c11)

## Current State
`Key.elm` is now a working effect manager. It is largely a clone of
[`Random`](https://github.com/elm-lang/core/blob/master/src/Random.elm).

Main.elm is a toy interface to help quickly debug.

## Reasoning for Using an Effect Manager
Currently the code in Key.elm does work provided you pass the `Seed` generated
by Random.step into the model of your host application. This `Key` library will
ultimately be used as a part of a much larger firebase library that has, thus
far, avoided inserting update messages, states, and subscriptions into the host
application.

The reason this is incompatible with the existing `Random.generate`
implementation is there is a time sensitive part of the key. The elm `Time`
library uses `Task`s while the `Random` library uses its own types. You cannot
make a randomly generated string that has a time dependent component due to the
inability to compose the types generated by these libraries.

The seed used by this SHOULD be a global state and calling `Key.generate` SHOULD
cause global side effects by updating that key. It is not ideal for there to be
a potential data race in the host application that may cause duplicate "random"
parts of these firebase keys.
